google-drive-extract-images
===========================

Extracts images from google drive using Google Drive APIs

The code is super simple and does not intend to handle any corner cases. It was really a single use thing that I have saved to github. Feel free to use as a sample tool to see how google api is used. Among other missing things, I have been lazy enough to not have implemented a proper CLI to ask for cliend id etc. To use, you have to open the file and modify the following:

CLIENT_ID = 'CLIENT_ID'
CLIENT_SECRET = 'CLIENT_SECRET'
folder_id = 'folder-id'

Installing python client API
----------------------------
easy_install --upgrade google-api-python-client

Google API enabling
